Content files
--------------------------


The ``miyadaiku-build`` command processes following type of files in the ``contents`` directory as content files to generate HTML.

- \*.yml file
- \*.rst file
- \*.md file
- \*.html file
- \*.ipynb file


The result of the command are directed to the ``outputs`` directory. Other files than the above are not processed as source files and are copied directly to the outputs directory.



The contents of the `` contents`` directory are of the following four types.

Article
   The document file in the `` contents`` directory is read as an article, and generates HTML with Jinja2 template engine.


Snippet
   A snippet is a document file like an article, but it is not converted to an HTML page. Snippets are read from other articles and templates.

Index
    Create a index page of articles for blog sites. Search the articles to be displayed and output HTML files of multiple pages.

Config
    The config file is a YAML file that specifies the settings of the entire Miyadaiku project and default values ​​of document properties for each directory. No outputs are generated by config files.



Templates
-------------------

Content files in the ``contents`` directory are processed by reST, Markdown parser, etc., and then converted to HTML by the Jinja2 template engine. From the generated HTML, the final HTML files are created with the Jinja template in the ``templates`` directory and output to the ``outputs`` directory.
